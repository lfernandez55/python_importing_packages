# python_importing_packages

There are two demos here

I. The first demo is executed by doing

python_importing_packages>python foo.py

which outputs:

executing foo_1 function
executing bar_1 function
executing boo_1 function
executing boo_1 function

II. The second demo duplicates the code described at
https://timothybramlett.com/How_to_create_a_Python_Package_with___init__py.html

Execute it by doing:

python_importing_packages/somefolder>python example2.py

which outputs:
